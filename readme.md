## How to make it run?

Frontend lives in `ui` directory and backend lives run in `generator` directory.

Go to `ui` directory and run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`.

It will run frontend at port `:5173`

Again, go to `generator` directory and run `go run main.go`.

It will run backend at port `:3000`

Then, open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser and you are good to go.
